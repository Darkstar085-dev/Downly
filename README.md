- **UI:** Download, History, and Settings screens are implemented with Jetpack Compose.
- **Update flow:** GitHub Release lookup, manifest validation, APK digest verification, and installer
  handling live under `core/update/`.
- **Local data:** Download state and history are managed in the app; downloaded media stays in
  app-specific/media storage.

## Building

### Requirements

- Android Studio and Android SDK 37.
- JDK 17.
- Android 11 or later (API 30+).
- The Downly YouTubeDL Kotlin artifacts must be available in the local Maven repository before
  Gradle can resolve them.

### Prepare dependencies

The app currently resolves these artifacts from `mavenLocal()`, not Maven Central:

- `io.github.darkstar085.youtubedl-kotlin:library:1.0.1`
- `io.github.darkstar085.youtubedl-kotlin:ffmpeg:1.0.1`
- `io.github.darkstar085.youtubedl-kotlin:aria2c:1.0.1`

Publish the corresponding `library`, `ffmpeg`, and `aria2c` modules from the matching
`youtubedl-kotlin` source project to your local Maven repository before building. A fresh clone does
not include these Maven artifacts. CI builds need the same artifacts installed or made available
from a remote Maven repository.

### Build a debug APK

Linux / macOS:

```bash
./gradlew :app:assembleDebug
```

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
.\gradlew.bat :app:assembleDebug
```

The debug APK is written to `app/build/outputs/apk/debug/`.

## Storage, Permissions & Privacy

Downloads are stored in app-specific/media storage. No broad storage permission is requested by this
app. Clearing app data or uninstalling removes app-specific files.

Downly uses network access to retrieve media, check supported sources, and query GitHub Releases for
updates. Source-site behavior and available formats can change. Some media may require
authentication or may be unavailable.
